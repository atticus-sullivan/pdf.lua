# pdf.lua
Kinda fork of https://codeberg.org/catseye/pdf.lua to include into memoize https://github.com/sasozivanovic/memoize

See https://github.com/sasozivanovic/memoize/issues/38 for tracking.

The only purpose of this repository is to monitor changes done to the original pdf.lua and some organizational matters (like TODOs etc).

This repository most probably will deleted after it works and the library is included into the memoize package.
